# d2tools

A selection of tools used to inspect Diablo II stash files (.d2x) created by ATMA/GoMule.

Definitely an unfinished project with many targets for improvement. The primary objective was to have fun,
learn more about D2 binary storage data, and tinker with item modification.

Many thanks to [nokka](https://github.com/nokka). Nearly all of the item parsing in Item.java was ported from [nokka/d2s](https://github.com/nokka/d2s)
